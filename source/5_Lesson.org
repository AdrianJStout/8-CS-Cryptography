- Cryptography is not just for spies and secret agents. We all use cryptography, every day.
- There are lots of apps and websites that use cryptography to communicate between clients and servers.
- Public Key Cryptography is very complicated, but here is a quick outline of how it works.
  1. If you are on an https:// website or you see the little green padlock in your URL bar, you are communicating with a website using a type of public key cryptography called SSL/TLS
  2. When you connect to the website server, the server sends you it's public key.
  3. Your client machine then generates a random number to use as a session key. This random number is encrypted with the public key and sent to the server.
  4. The server decrypts the random number with it's private key. As only the server has the private key, only it can decrypt the session key.
  5. Now only the client and server have the unique session key. They can use this to encrypt data and send it between them, knowing only the client and server can decrypt the messages

- Draw a diagram to show how SSL/TLS encryption works, using the characters Alice, Bob and Eve.
- Here's an example of the type of diagram, although this is just for basic encryption.
